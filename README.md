# Sudo-Solve
An AI agent that solves diagonal sudoku game. We will implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. This project is part of Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.
